The purpose of this repository is to ideate and plan key allocation for macro pads that I want to create, build, or use for optimizing speech-to-text.

I use speech recognition through ASR models intensively all day. It has effectively replaced typing as my main form of text entry. Using these, I repeatedly use a core collection of functions: starting and stopping transcription, sending transcription, sending recorded audio for transcription in one operation (which is a combined stop and transcribe operation), stopping without sending for transcription, appending text to an existing, appending a voice recording to an existing one in order to add information before sending for transcription, simply sending for transcription, and a delete functionality.

I have created my own voice notepad interface designed to streamline the process of recording text for this purpose. It also includes format selection utilities to format the text according to specific, commonly used formats like notes, blog ideas, et cetera. I'm including some screenshots in the repository of these. I've purchased a number of macro pads from the internet. There is an almost limitless amount of these available. There are also keyboards, another approach is to use keyboards with macro keys and to use tools like Stream Decks to make these available.

The purpose of this planning repository is to come up with ideas and work with you to suggest the most obvious and natural key layouts for these, as well as identify suggested key mappings. The key mappings will be done with onto a system running Linux, Ubuntu Linux, and the objective is that they won't conflict, they'll be globally available but non-conflicting with other keyboard shortcuts, so we will make particular use of the F keys beyond F12, like F13 through F24, as long as they're defined in the basic keyboard definition, or we will find other ways of remapping using tools like Input Remapper.

I might provide a specific piece of hardware that I have on hand and ask you to suggest a key layout. The key objective here is to think of ergonomics and natural hand positioning to make the actual use seem very, very seamless, considering an intended use case, whereby I'm using this all day, and this little this macro pad or this voice transcription notepad is to a large extent taking the place of a keyboard as the primary mechanism for text entry.
